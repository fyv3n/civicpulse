# CivicPulse — Thesis Project
**Built with DeepSeek-R3**

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains all the code and supporting materials for my thesis project, **CivicPulse**.

## 🧠 Model
I’m using **DeepSeek-R3**, accessed via API. The model is provided under the **DeepSeek model license**, which varies depending on usage.  
Please note that even if you're paying for API access, this license still applies to how you can use or redistribute the model and its outputs.  
You can review the model and its license here:  
- [DeepSeek-R3 GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3)  
- [DeepSeek API Documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250325)

## ⚖️ Legal & Attribution
- **License**: DeepSeek-R3 is subject to the official DeepSeek model license, which governs use cases including commercial or API-based projects.  
- **API Usage**: Using the model via API generally means you’re still bound by the model license, even if your usage is paid. Make sure to review the license details before deploying or sharing outputs publicly.  
- **Credits**: DeepSeek-R3 is the intellectual property of DeepSeek-AI; all rights are retained by them.
